Team Folder Storage has limitation(530MB)
But our team project src file is over 530MB
because of opencv library.
So we only upload it on team leader's assignment sector.

The reason why we included opencv library in the source folder is that
the specification on teamproject02 presented we need to submit compilable files.


The full projecT(include opencv) is on Team leader's assignment section
The project(exclude opencv) is on Team Repository.

If need to test using team repository src need to put opencv4.5.4 library in folder.
